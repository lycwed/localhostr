# localhostR

This tool is made to display your localhost's projects in a pretty way in your browser.


## How to

- Download the zip.
- Unzip in the folder of your localhost.
- Don't change the folder name 'LOCALHOSTR'.
- Check you don't have any file call 'index.php' at the root.
- Open it in your browser (ex: http://localhost:8080/LOCALHOSTR).
- That's it! Enjoy ^^.
